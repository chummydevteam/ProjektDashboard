# ProjektDashboard.Layers
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicholaschum/ProjektDashboard.svg?branch=layers)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholaschum/ProjektDashboard)

projekt dashboard.layers is a Layers utility for chummy development team themes; a Notification Header Swapper for chummy development themes out there on Play Store and a set of tools to help you diagnose and clean up your device.

### _Instructions: Color Switcher (cdt themes ONLY)_
- You Must have akzent installed in order to use this dashboard.
- You have all the options in every tab specified accordingly.
- BY USING THIS ON A CDT THEME, YOU WILL BREAK BATTERY STATS due to Marshmallow's Java tint mode on the Battery Chart. We are actively working to fix this and as your nightlies progress, so should this be automatically fixed.

### _Instructions: Notification Header Swapper_
- I Dont Support any other layers theme's other than made by me. 
- Go to the Specific Tab and click the FAB Button to select the image.
- If after soft rebooting you don't get anything changed, do it again with the theme installed on the enabled device and soft reboot (at most twice). This will hardcode your drawables into the base apk, and you can patch up another theme apk if you want.Im looking for a fix too,will be solved.

### _ATTENTION_ 
- Color Picker works off the cache thus hotswapping is allowed, but when you modify the header, the cache is destroyed, so you must soft reboot...THEN pick a color.
